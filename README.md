# React Workshop

This workshop contains exercises to help you understand how to create and test  applications using React library.

Every exercise has a corresponding branch `exercise-x` (where `x` equals exercise number) with setup code.

In case you get lost you can checkout setup code for the next exercise, which is the solution for the previous one.
